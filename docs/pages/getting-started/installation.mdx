## Developer Installation

This section outlines the installation process for the R2R framework. Our recommended approach is to following the [full install](#full-install) guidelines to fully leverage the options offered by `config.json`. However, if you just want to set it up as a package to test how it works, you can do it via [fast install](#fast-install).

### Quick Navigation

- [Fast Install](#fast-install): Quick setup using `pip`.
- [Full Install](#full-install): Detailed setup to leverage `config.json`.
  1. [Config Setup (Optional)](#config-setup-optional): Create `.env` and `config.json`.
  2. [Install Poetry](#install-poetry): Ensure Poetry is installed.
  3. [Clone and Install Dependencies](#clone-and-install-dependencies): Get the project and its dependencies.
  4. [Configure Environment Variables](#configure-environment-variables): Set up necessary `.env` configurations.

### Fast Install:

    **Install R2R directly using `pip`:**

    ```bash
    pip install r2r
    ```

### Full Install:

The core idea of a Full install is to fully leverage the `config.json` file in order to setup your pipelines.

##### Config Setup (Optional)

This script will update a `.env.example` file and a `config.json` files according to your installation preferences. Both files will contain the necessary environment variables for the project to get initialized properly.

_Make the Script Executable (if it's not already):_

```bash
chmod +x setup_config.sh
```

- _Run the Script:_

```bash
./setup_config.sh
```

- _Follow the Prompts:_ The script will guide you through several configuration options, including selecting your vector database provider (PostgreSQL or Qdrant), setting up the embedding provider (currently OpenAI), choosing the OpenAI model, and specifying other settings such as dimension and batch size. Simply follow the prompts and enter your choices.

##### Install Poetry:

- Before installing the project, make sure you have Poetry on your system. If not, visit the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for installation instructions.

##### Clone and Install Dependencies:

- Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:SciPhi-AI/r2r.git
  cd r2r
  ```
- Install the project dependencies with Poetry:
  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```

##### Configure Environment Variables:

- You need to set up cloud provider secrets in your `.env` file for the project to work properly. At a minimum, you will need an OpenAI key and a vector database provider.
- For a fast setup, we recommend creating a project on Supabase, enabling the vector extension, and then updating the `.env.example` with the necessary details.
- Other providers are also available, such as Qdrant for vector database support.
- Once updated, copy the `.env.example` to `.env` to apply your configurations:
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

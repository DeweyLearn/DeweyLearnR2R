<summary><b>Installing with Pip</b>&nbsp;üêç </summary>

Install R2R using `pip` to get started with minimal setup. This method will get you set up with the default configuration:

```bash
# use the `'r2r[all]'` to download all required deps
pip install r2r

# setup env 
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

<summary><b>Installing with Docker</b>&nbsp;üê≥</summary>

To run R2R using Docker, you can use the following commands:

```bash filename="bash" copy
docker pull emrgntcmplxty/r2r:latest
```

This will pull the latest R2R Docker image.

Be sure to set an OpenAI API key in your environment and then run the container with:

```bash filename="bash" copy
docker run -d \
  --name r2r \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY \
  emrgntcmplxty/r2r:latest
```

This command starts the R2R container with the following options:

- `--name r2r`: Assigns the name "r2r" to the container.
- `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`: Adds a host entry for the Docker host.
- `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 of the container to port 8000 of the host.
- `-e OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY`: Pulls your OpenAI API key from your local enviornment for use in the container.
- `emrgntcmplxty/r2r:latest`: Specifies the Docker image to use.

## Environment Setup

Below are examples of environment variables that can be configured to facilitate additional downstream functionality.

### Language Model Providers

#### OpenAI API Key

Used by default for embedding and LLM completions:

```bash filename="bash" copy
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

#### Other LLM Providers (Anthropic, Vertex AI, etc.)

Configure your environment for additional providers:

```bash filename="bash" copy
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
export VERTEX_API_KEY=...
# Add other provider keys as needed
```

### VectorDB Providers

#### R2R Local VectorDB

R2R default selection - a simple SQLite-powered vector DB, optimal for lightweight workloads:

```bash filename="bash" copy
export LOCAL_DB_PATH=local.sqlite
```

#### pgvector

Better for larger scale workloads that benefit from relational data:

```bash filename="bash" copy
export POSTGRES_USER=your_user
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
export POSTGRES_HOST=your_host
export POSTGRES_PORT=your_port
export POSTGRES_DBNAME=your_db
```

### Customization and Configuration

R2R provides extensive options to customize and configure your pipeline to suit specific needs. You can configure various providers through the `config.json` file and set environment variables as shown above to specify your vector database, embedding, language model, evaluation, and logging providers.

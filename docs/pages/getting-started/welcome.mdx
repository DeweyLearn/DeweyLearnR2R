# Welcome to R2R

## What is R2R?

R2R, short for `From RAG to Riches`, is a Python framework designed for the rapid construction and deployment of production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

We built this **semi-opinionated framework** to help developers seeking to move from experimental stages to production-grade RAG systems. Unlike other frameworks with too many layers of abstraction, we aim to keep things simple and build from first principles to accelerate your development process.

## Key Features

- **Rapid Deployment**: Accelerates the transition from experimental stages to **production-grade RAG systems**.
- **Semi-Opinionated Framework**: Provides `structure` while allowing `flexibility` in implementation.
- **Core Abstractions**: Focuses on three main pipelines: `Ingestion`, `Embedding`, and `RAG` for streamlined data processing and generation.
- **Extensibility**: Supports the development of `custom pipelines` and integration with various `database` and `embedding` providers.
- **Developer-Friendly Setup**: Offers both `fast` and `full installation` options, including environment configuration scripts.
- **Community Support**: We'll help you build your RAG system and support you in the journey as we've faced many of the same frustrations.
- **Up to date Documentation**: We'll regularly update our docs and introduce changes in a way that they we preserve SLA uptime of production-deployed systems with our framework.
